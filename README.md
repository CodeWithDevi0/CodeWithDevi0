# Hi, I'm DEVwannabe 👨‍💻, a student exploring web development

I'm a 3rd year IT student (20 y/o) who's somehow survived this far without breaking the internet... yet.
I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing half the time... but I do it anyway.
Frontend? Backend? I just Google everything and... AI? Yesser! They explain things that our instructor didn't teach anyway.
I love you, AIs.

I use GitHub to share my “experiments,” track my attempts at learning, and pretend I know what version control is.
GitHub is also where I store my experiments, bug collections, and occasional wins (after 37 tries).

I specialize in confidently Googling errors I don’t understand and pasting code that “somehow works.”
Laravel is currently my toxic coding relationship... I love it, it hurts me, and I come back anyway.

This profile is 50% portfolio, 50% confusion, and 100% me trying my best.

## 📚 Currently Learning

- Laravel (PHP Framework)
- Improving my understanding of MVC and OOP principles
- Version control workflows using Git and GitHub

---

## 📁 Projects & Practice

I treat GitHub as a semi-profile and learning journal.  
You’ll find small projects, experiments, and personal practice files mostly web-based systems and student projects using PHP, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

---

## 🔎 Goals

- Become more confident in programming
- Build more Laravel-based projects
- Sharpen front-end and back-end integration skills
